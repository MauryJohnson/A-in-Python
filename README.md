A* Search Algorithm

python StartEGen.py map_5.txt
Returns points labelling what the coordinates are.
requires StartEGen.py and EnvGen.py

python Astar.py 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 -> 10 10 20 20
will travel to coordinates (0.2,0.2) from (0.1,0.1) -> 10,10 20,20 are the coordinates in the increased graph size (multiply by 100)
